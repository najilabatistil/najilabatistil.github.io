        The Strokes is an American rock band formed in New York City in 1998. The band is composed of lead singer and
        primary songwriter Julian Casablancas, guitarists Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr., bassist Nikolai Fraiture,
        and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. Their debut album ‘Is This It’ sparked a garage rock revival and earned critical
        acclaim worldwide. Known for their raw sound and effortless cool, they became icons of 2000s rock. With hits
        like Reptilia and Last Nite, their influence still echoes through modern music. Over two decades in, they
        continue to evolve while staying true to their roots.
